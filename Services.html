“John and his crew were very easy to work with and built us a fantastic new deck and hot tub. We love it! During <br/>
the design & build phase John was open to new design ideas to incorporate into his plan and always took the time to answer <br/>
my many questions. His crew was always polite and cleaned up the site each day before they left. I highly recommend them if you are considering a new deck for your home.”<br/>
