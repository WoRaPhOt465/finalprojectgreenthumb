        ABOUT GREEN THUMB LANDSCAPING

        Green Thumb Landscaping got its roots in one of the greenest, most picturesque landscapes in the world - 
        Ireland. <br/>
        The lush countryside of owner and operator John Duane's homeland is known to have "40 Shades of Green".
        
        Today, John employs the most knowledgeable, capable and hardworking team. 
        <br/>
        Each member contributes their own individual talents 
        and strong suits, but they all have one thing in common - commitment to providing customers with quality products and courteous services. 
        <br/>
        From regular lawn maintenance and installing sandstone steps to laying simple pathways and designing complex custom yards, our diverse team has the qualifications to make your vision reality.
        <br/> <br/>
        We take pride in even the smallest project, and are meticulous down to the last blade of grass.
    
        We take a customer-first approach to everything we do.
        
        Our team is creative, courteous, 
        <br/>
        thorough and efficient, and communicates every step of the way to ensure your expectations are met.
        
        Green Thumb Landscaping treats outdoor spaces like indoor spaces. 
        <br>
        Rocks and debris are picked up and removed, entertaining areas and driveways are blown free of dust and dead and decaying vegetation is pruned away. 
       <br>
        No clean up required. When the work is done, the only thing left for you to do is kick up your feet and bask in your picture-ready surroundings. And you may not even know we were there.
